<p class="p4 center fs175">MRS. PARTRIDGE PRESENTS</p>

<p>Comedy in 3 acts. By Mary Kennedy and Ruth Hawthorne.
6 males, 6 females. Modern costumes. 2 interiors.
Plays 2½ hours.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>The characters, scenes and situations are thoroughly up-to-date
in this altogether delightful American comedy. The heroine
is a woman of tremendous energy, who manages a business&mdash;as
she manages everything&mdash;with great success, and at home presides
over the destinies of a growing son and daughter. Her
struggle to give the children the opportunities she herself had
missed, and the children’s ultimate revolt against her well-meant
management&mdash;that is the basis of the plot. The son who is cast
for the part of artist and the daughter who is to go on the stage
offer numerous opportunities for the development of the comic
possibilities in the theme.</p>

<p>The play is one of the most delightful, yet thought-provoking
American comedies of recent years, and is warmly recommended
to all amateur groups, (Royalty on application.)</p>

<p class="rt">Price, 75 Cents.</p>
</div>


<p class="p2 center fs175">IN THE NEXT ROOM</p>

<p>Melodrama in 3 acts. By Eleanor Robson and Harriet
Ford. 8 males, 3 females. 2 interiors. Modern costumes.
Plays 2¼ hours.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Philip Vantine has bought a rare copy of an original Boule
cabinet and ordered it shipped to his New York home from Paris.
When it arrives it is found to be the original itself, the possession
of which is desired by many strange people. Before the
mystery concerned with the cabinet’s shipment can be cleared
up, two persons meet mysterious death fooling with it and the
happiness of many otherwise happy actors is threatened” (Burns
Mantle). A first-rate mystery play, comprising all the elements
of suspense, curiosity, comedy and drama. “In the Next Room”
is quite easy to stage. It can be unreservedly recommended to
high schools and colleges. (Royalty, twenty-five dollars.)</p>

<p class="drop-capy"><em>The doorway from the public stairs opens immediately
upon the living-room without the
intervening privacy of a small hallway. The
room was, no doubt, more formally pretentious in the
early days of the</em> <span class="smcap">Williams’</span> <em>marriage; but the
relics of that time&mdash;some rigid mahogany chairs
and stray pieces of staid furniture&mdash;have been ruthlessly
pushed against the walls, so that one perceives a
“parlor” transformed into a miscellaneous room upon
which the flat’s overflow has gradually crept. And
with this has come</em> <span class="smcap">Grant Williams’</span> <em>plain wooden
work-table, bearing now a writer’s accessories, a desk
lamp, and a mass of manuscripts; one of which is his
unproduced drama</em>, <span class="smcap">The Lonely Way</span>, <em>bound in
the conventional blue linen cover. His well-worn
typewriter is perched on the end of the table, in easy
reach of his work-chair with its sofa cushions crushed
and shaped to his form. Another chair is near by, so
that it also may catch the flood of light which comes
from the conventional electric bunch-light above. There
is a small black kerosene heater to be used in those
emergencies of temperature which landlords create.
Not far from it, a child’s collapsible go-cart is propped.
On the walls, above some over-flowing bookshelves, are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
several tastefully selected etchings. A window in back,
which hides an airshaft, is partly concealed by heavy
curtains that hang tired and limp. There is another
doorway, directly opposite the entrance, which leads
to the other rooms of a characteristically compressed
city flat.</em></p>

<p><em>Yet the room is not forbidding: it merely suggests
forced economies that have not quite fringed poverty:
continual adaptation, as it were, to the financial contingencies
of a marriage that has just managed to make
both ends meet.</em></p>

<p><em>When the curtain rises</em> <span class="smcap">Jerry Williams</span> <em>is seated
in the cozy chair reading a number of newspaper clippings</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerry</span> <em>is an attractive woman in her thirties. Externally,
there is nothing particularly striking about
her: if there be such a thing as an average wife</em> <span class="smcap">Jerry</span>
<em>personifies it. She has loved her husband and kept
house for him without a spoken protest; for she has
had no advanced ideas or theories. Yet she has had
her fears and little concealments and dreams&mdash;like any
married woman. She has been sustained through the
ten years of hard sledding by the belief in her husband’s
ultimate financial success. And as she reads the
criticisms of his play</em>, <span class="smcap">The Sand Bar</span>, <em>produced the
night before, she realizes it has come at last. She is
now completely happy and calm in the thought of her
rewards.</em></p>

<p><em>She looks at the cheap watch lying on the desk and
indicates it is late. She closes the window, walks over
to the doorway and looks in, apparently to see if the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
child is still asleep. Then she closes the door and
stands there, with just a suspicion of impatience.</em></p>

<p><em>Several minutes pass. Then she gives a little cry of
joy as she hears the key turn in the lock and she sees
the hall door open slowly&mdash;admitting her husband.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grant Williams</span> <em>is a more striking personality than
his wife; about forty, with a tinge of iron gray on his
temples, he has a strong virile face not without traces of
idealism. His whole appearance is normal and devoid
of any conscious affectation of dress. But a very close
inspection might reveal that his suit, though carefully
pressed, is well worn&mdash;as is the overcoat which covers
it.</em> <span class="smcap">Grant</span> <em>happens to be a man of cultivation and
breeding, with a spark of genius, who has strayed into
strange pastures. At present there lurks an unexpected
depression back of his mood; perhaps it is only the
normal reaction which comes to every artist when success
is won and the critical sense within mocks the
achievement so beneath the dream. Perhaps with</em>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Tom</span></p>

<p>But I’m not a hero: I’m an artist. You know the

<p>Food and fighting. You will observe her large

was her long powerfully muscled tail. From the teeth,
we deduce she was mainly herbivorous.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Livingston</span></p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Livingston</span></p>

<p>Exactly. You see, Mr. Hood, a dead tree, that has
in its time given shelter and substance, fights to be
left standing. It resists the alien ax. Its roots go as
deep as when they flowed with sap. They also fight
to prevent themselves from being torn up. They don’t
like to be disturbed&mdash;any more than this animal did
in its cold clayey comfort. (<em>To</em> <span class="smcap">Professor</span>) You say

There is also a doorway in back, which apparently

<p>No. Perhaps it will be easier this way. (<em>He hesitates,

Yes. Long Distance? Washington? (<em>Her lips repeat
the word.</em>) Yes. This is William White. Hello.
Yes. Is this the Secretary speaking? Oh, I appreciate
the honor of having you confirm it personally. Senator
Bough is chairman? At <em>his</em> request? Ah, yes;
war makes strange bedfellows. Yes. The passport

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>You, too!</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p>I’ve been trying to tell you these last weeks; but
I couldn’t somehow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>No, dear; only I knew it would hurt you.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>I’m not thinking of myself but of you. You are
going to be part of this war?</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p>I’m going to do what I can to help finish it.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>By compromising with the beliefs of a lifetime?</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p>No, dear; not that. I’ve accepted the appointment
on this commission because I’m going to accept facts.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>Have the facts of war changed or is it you?</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p>Neither has changed; but I’m going to act differently.
I’m going to be part of it. Yes. I’m going to
help direct the current.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>I can’t believe what I am hearing. Is it you,
William White, speaking? You who, for twenty
years, have stood against <em>all</em> war!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>And now when the test comes you are going to lend
yourself to it! You of all men!</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p>Hilda, dear; I didn’t expect you to accept it easily;
but I think I can make you see if you will let me.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p class="center">(<em>Poignantly</em>)</p>

<p>If I will <em>let</em> you! Why, Will, I must understand;
I must.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p>Perhaps it will be difficult at first&mdash;with your
standards.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>But my standards were yours, Will. You gave
them to me. You taught me. You took a young girl
who loved you. You showed her the truth, and she
followed you and has followed you gladly through
hard years of struggle and poverty because of those
ideals. And now you talk of <em>my</em> standards! Will,
don’t you see, I <em>must</em> understand?</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p>Dear, standards are relative things; they differ with
circumstance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>Have your ideals only been old clothes you change
to suit the weather?</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p>It’s the end we must keep in mind. <em>I</em> haven’t
changed or compromised one bit in that. I’m working
in changed conditions, that’s all; working with all
my heart to do away with all war.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>By fighting one?</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p class="center">(<em>With eloquence</em>)</p>

<p>Yes. Because it is necessary. I’ve come to see we
can’t argue war out of the world with words. We’ve
got to beat it out of the world. It can’t be done with
our hands lifted up in prayer; it can only be done
with iron hands crushing it down. War is the mood
of the world. Well, I’m going to fight in my fashion.
And when it is over I’m going to keep on fighting; for
the next war will be greater than this. It will be
economic revolution. It will be the war of capital
and labor. And I mean to be ready.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p class="center">(<em>Listening incredulously</em>)</p>

<p>And to get ready you are willing to link arms now
with Senator Bough&mdash;a man you once called the lackey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
of Wall Street&mdash;a man who has always opposed every
democratic principle....</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p>Yes. Don’t you see the Government is beginning
to realize they can’t do without us? Don’t you see my
appointment is an acknowledgment of the rising tide
of radicalism in the world? Don’t you see, with the
prestige that will come to me from this appointment,
I will have greater power after the war; power to
bring about the realization of all our dreams; power
to demand&mdash;even at the Peace table itself, perhaps&mdash;that
all wars must end?</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>Do you actually believe you will have any power
with your <em>own</em> people when you have compromised
them for a temporary expediency?</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p class="center">(<em>With a gesture</em>)</p>

<p>The leader must be wiser than the people who
follow.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>So, contempt for your people is the first thing your
new power has brought you! (<em>He makes a gesture of
denial.</em>) You feel you are above them&mdash;not of them.
Do you believe for a moment that Senator Bough has
anything but contempt for you, too?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>


<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p class="center">(<em>Confidently</em>)</p>

<p>He needs me.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>Needs you? Don’t you understand why he had you
appointed on that committee? He wanted to get you
out of the way.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p>Isn’t that an acknowledgment of my power?</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>Yes. You’re a great asset <em>now</em>. You’re a “reformed”
radical. Why, Will, he’ll use you in the
capitals of Europe to advertise his liberalism; just as
the prohibitionist exhibits a reformed drunkard.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p>And I tell you, Hilda, after the war I shall be
stronger than he is, stronger than any of them.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>No man is strong unless he does what he feels is
right. No, no, Will; you’ve convicted yourself with
your own eloquence. You’ve wanted to do this for
some reason. But it isn’t the one you’ve told me.
No; no.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p class="center">(<em>Angrily</em>)</p>

<p>You doubt my sincerity?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>No; only the way you have read yourself.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p>Well, if you think I’ve tried to make it easy for myself
you are mistaken. Is it easy to pull out of the
rut and habit of years? Easy to know my friends will
jeer and say I’ve sold out? Easy to have <em>you</em> misunderstand?
(<em>Goes to her.</em>) Hilda, I’m doing this
for their good. I’m doing it&mdash;just as Wallace is&mdash;because
I feel it’s right.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>No; you shouldn’t say that. You are not doing this
for the same reason Wallace is. He believes in this
war. He has accepted it all simply without a question.
If you had seen the look in his eyes, you would
have known he was a dedicated spirit; there was no
shadow, no doubt; it was pure flame. But you! You
believe differently! You can’t hush the mind that for
twenty years has thought no war ever could henceforth
be justified. You can’t give yourself to this war without
tricking yourself with phrases. You see power in it
and profit for yourself. (<em>He protests.</em>) That’s your
own confession. You are only doing what is expedient&mdash;not
what is right. Oh, Will, don’t compare your
motives with those of our son. I sent him forth, without
a word of protest, because he wishes to die for his
own ideals: you are killing your own ideals for the
ideals of others! (<em>She turns away.</em>) Oh, Will, that’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
what hurts. If you were only like him, I&mdash;I could
stand it.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p class="center">(<em>Quietly, after a pause</em>)</p>

<p>I can’t be angry at you&mdash;even when you say such
things. You’ve been too much a part of my life, and
work, and I love you, Hilda. You know that, don’t
you, dear? (<em>He sits beside her and takes her hand.</em>)
I knew it would be difficult to make you understand.
Only once have I lacked courage and that was when
I felt myself being drawn into this and they offered me
the appointment. For then I saw I must tell you.
You know I never have wanted to cause you pain.
But when you asked me to let Wallace go, I thought
you would understand my going, too.&mdash;Oh, perhaps
our motives are different; he is young: war has caught
his imagination; but, I, too, see a duty, a way to accomplish
my ideals.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>Let’s leave ideals out of this now. It’s like bitter
enemies praying to the same God as they kill each
other.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p>Yes. War is full of ironies. I see that: Wallace
can’t. It’s so full of mixed motives, good and bad.
Yes. I’ll grant all that. Only America has gone in.
The whole tide was against us, dear. It is sweeping
over the world: a brown tide of khaki sweeping everything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
before it. All my life I’ve fought against the
current. (<em>Wearily</em>) And now that I’ve gone in, too,
my arms seem less tired. Yes; and except for the pain
I’ve caused you, I’ve never in all my life felt so&mdash;so
happy.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">(<em>Then she understands. She slowly turns to
him, with tenderness in her eyes.</em>)</p>
</div>


<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>Oh, now, Will, I do understand. Now I see the
real reason for what you’ve done.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p class="center">(<em>Defensively</em>)</p>

<p>I’ve given the real reason.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p class="center">(<em>Her heart going out to him</em>)</p>

<p>You poor tired man. My dear one. Forgive me,
if I made it difficult for you; if I said cruel words. I
ought to have guessed; ought to have seen what life has
done to you. (<em>He looks up, not understanding her
words.</em>) Those hands of yours first dug a living out
of the ground. Then they built houses and grew
strong because you were a workman&mdash;a man of the
people. You saw injustice and all your life you fought
against those who had the power to inflict it: the press;
the comfortable respectables, like my brother; and
even those of your own group who opposed you&mdash;you
fought them all. And they look at you as an outsider,
an alien in your own country. Oh, Will, I know how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
hard it has been for you to be always on the defensive,
against the majority. It is hard to live alone
away from the herd. It does tire one to the bone and
make one envious of the comfort and security they
find by being together.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p>Yes ... but....</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>Now the war comes and with it a chance to get
back; to be part of the majority; to be welcomed with
open arms by those who have fought you; to go back
with honor and praise. And, yes, to have the warmth
and comfort of the crowd. That’s the real reason
you’re going in. You’re tired and worn out with the
fight. I know. I understand now.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">White</span></p>

<p class="center">(<em>Earnestly</em>)</p>

<p>If I thought it was that, I’d kill myself.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Hilda</span></p>

<p>There’s been enough killing already. I have to
understand it somehow to accept it at all.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Patricia</span></p>

<p>And what have you heard about me? Let’s see if
it is correct. My name? It isn’t my own. My real<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
one wouldn’t look well on the advertising. Besides,
my father hadn’t given me any reason to be proud
of it. My mother may have been a good soul
if I had ever really known her. I’ve always thought
I was an unwanted child: I hate children so myself.
But mother couldn’t have been the sort who’d drink
with ease out of your frail tea-cups, and I’ll warrant
no amount of coaching would have kept the veneer
from peeling when she spoke. I grew up somehow
among “beer and skittles,” as Trilby would say;
didn’t know what pictures and teas and things were
till I came East. And do you know <em>how</em> I came?
<em>He</em> seemed so handsome, too, in those days.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">(<em>Moving uneasily as she sees a grim smile come to</em>

</div>


<p>But, dear, you were young and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Patricia</span></p>

<p>Oh, I knew better; but I was bored&mdash;bored out there
and I wanted a chance to live. We didn’t get along
very well&mdash;he and I; partly my fault. He couldn’t be
happy with a woman who also had a spark of creation
tucked away in her soul. Then, besides, I had made
up my mind I’d do something because I had to keep
alive. I turned to the stage&mdash;most of us poor fools do.
But I happened to have a way with me and a pair of
shoulders that were proud of my face. (<em>Sarcastically</em>.)
The critics called it personality. (<em>Quickly</em>) I wonder
if you also know I lived in a five-dollar-a-week boarding-house
with circus acrobats on the floor above, a sad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
soprano in a closet next to mine and a smell of cooking
all over so I wouldn’t be lonely? (<em>Almost unconsciously
her voice at times betrays an unexpected commonness.</em>)
How I hated it! How I wanted these
feathers and gilt! And every time I made up my
face in that two-by-four part I had, I determined to
succeed somehow&mdash;<em>anyhow</em>. I deserve every bit of
success I’ve got, for I worked hard getting the burrs
out of my speech and some grammar into it. (<span class="smcap">Mrs.
Frowde</span> <em>moves uncomfortably again</em>.) That’s the
truth. People suspected I had a brain and I had; but
I wasn’t wasting it on books&mdash;I was studying the hearts
and souls of the sort of people I needed to get along.
(<em>With increasing relish at the effect of her revelations.</em>)
And I saw to succeed in my life I had to grow hard
inside and soft out. So I affected my husky voice and
my sad smile; sadness gave me a touch of mystery and
encouraged curiosity. I knew I’d have to keep my
face smooth, too; so I stopped feeling for others and
thought only of myself. Suffering isn’t good for
the complexion. But I helped everybody in convenient
ways, because I knew I could make them
help me in greater. And as I began to get along I
went out more to teas and the like so I could meet the
people I could use.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Frowde</span></p>

<p>But, my dear....</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Patricia</span></p>

<p>Oh, I’m not ungrateful for their kindness, but I
owe them nothing, for I repaid them, by letting them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
do things for me. Yes, it flattered them to have me
about and to say they knew me “intimately.” I was
a good asset to their affairs because I was a success.
Then I picked up a lot of cant phrases about art and
the like, so I could prattle; and I even signed articles
which somebody else wrote lamenting the decline of
the stage, when I knew in my heart I was glad things
were as they were because I could make more money
with a dramatized novel or a tailor-made part than
in my much advertised and never intended appearance
in Shakespeare. (<em>Acting as with apparent conviction.</em>)
And back of this, life was calling me. So I did other
things to get along. My eyes were open and so it seems
were those of the world. It envied me my freedom because
I was a success. All of us don’t do it, but I did
and it wasn’t always for love. (<span class="smcap">Miss Stannard’s</span>
<em>quick breath halts her for a moment; then she adds
dramatically</em>) Yes, Mrs. Frowde, if you’re going to
draw the line somewhere at your teas, why don’t you
begin with me?</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Frowde</span></p>

<p class="center">(<em>Floundering</em>)</p>

<p>But&mdash;but you forget, dear, you&mdash;you are a great
creative artist.</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Patricia</span></p>

<p>No, I don’t. Everybody’s tolerance of my whims,
my moods, my morals would never let me forget it.
But what has that to do with the right and wrong of
it? That’s what you are wondering, Miss Stannard.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
(<span class="smcap">Miss Stannard</span> <em>gazes at her</em>.) I don’t ask any less
charity for myself because my “temperament” has
made me live my life my own way; though I don’t
need charity now I’m on top. (<em>Surging along effectively.</em>)
But why shouldn’t you and your friends extend
that same charity to the rest of the sinners?
(<span class="smcap">Patricia</span> <em>does not detect</em> <span class="smcap">Miss Stannard’s</span> <em>change of
manner so intent is she in her own words</em>.) You give
it to me because I am a creative artist. Everybody has
a bit of the artist in them. Some of us use it to make
bread; others use it to make trouble. All the nice
sinners of the world have the creative spirit, too. Sin
is the creating of the actual out of the imagined.
It’s falling over the fence in a desire to see what is on
the other side. (<em>Consciously shaping her words and
manner to a climax.</em>) But the more so are the sins
one does for love. Love is the most creative of all
impulses. If you forgive me because I’m an artist, as
you say; if you can ask <em>me</em> to sit beside your lily-faced
daughters and stubby-chinned sons; if you can kiss my
lips&mdash;I, who have openly violated all your standards&mdash;why
do you turn against this woman, who has done
what she has for the noblest of motives&mdash;love&mdash;the love
of a man?</p>

<p class="p15 center"><span class="smcap">Miss Stannard</span></p>

<p class="center">(<em>She has risen tensely and speaks with a biting bitterness</em>)</p>

<p>I suppose you meant very well, Miss Tenner; you
said it just as though it were a scene in some play&mdash;with
the proper emphasis and pause and nice phrases.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
But believe me, Mrs. Frowde is right: we can’t judge
people by the same standards. (<em>Contemptuously</em>)
There <em>is</em> a difference between you and me. <em>I</em> feel it
myself. When I need forgiveness I shall only want
it of my own class. (<em>Scornfully</em>) The tolerance of
yours means nothing to me. (<em>Very quietly</em>) I am
sorry, Mrs. Frowde. I’ll not call again till he and I
are married. Then, of course, it will be all right.

<p>Yes. Life’s an experiment. Remember the first

<p>If we only had more money I could do away with
the wilderness and content myself with a few wooded

a heap about men and things, though he lived in an
age when there wasn’t so much to remember as there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>

the comfort of it all; good, deep-reaching yawns, as
Nature intended. I went out to see my friends the
stars. Best friends a man ever had: a bit cold and
distant, perhaps; but always there behind the clouds.

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Sherman Fessenden, unable to induce servants to remain for
any reasonable length of time at his home, hits upon the novel
expedient of engaging detectives to serve as domestics.</p>

<p>His second wife, an actress, weary of the country and longing
for Broadway, has succeeded in discouraging every other cook and
butler against remaining long at the house, believing that by so
doing she will win her husband to her theory that country life
is dead. So she is deeply disappointed when she finds she cannot
discourage the new servants.</p>

<p>The sleuths, believing they had been called to report on the
actions of those living with the Fessendens, proceeded to warn
Mr. Fessenden that his wife has been receiving love-notes from
Steve Mark, an actor friend, and that his daughter has been
planning to elope with a thief.</p>

<p>One sleuth causes an uproar in the house, making a mess of
the situations he has witnessed. Mr. Fessenden, however, has
learned a lesson and is quite willing to leave the servant problem
to his wife thereafter. (Royalty, twenty-five dollars.)</p>

<p>Imagine a reckless and wealthy youth who writes ardent
love letters to a designing chorus girl, an attorney brother-in-law
who steals the letters and then gets his hand-bag mixed
up with the grip of a burglar who has just stolen a valuable
necklace from the mother of the indiscreet youth, and the
efforts of the crook to recover his plunder, as incidents in
the story of a play in which the swiftness of the action
never halts for an instant. Not only are the situations screamingly
funny but the lines themselves hold a fund of humor at
all times. This newest and cleverest of all farces was written
by Fred Jackson, the well-known short-story writer, and if
backed up by the prestige of an impressive New York success
and the promise of unlimited fun presented in the most attractive
form. A cleaner, cleverer farce has not been seen for many

Richman. 5 males, 7 females. 2 interiors, 1 exterior.
Costumes, 1876. Plays a full evening.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>Arthur Richman has constructed his play around the Cinderella
legend. The playwright has shown great wisdom in his choice
of material, for he has cleverly crossed the Cinderella theme
with a strain of Romeo and Juliet. Mr. Richman places his
young lovers in the picturesque New York of forty years ago.
This time Cinderella is a seamstress in the home of a social
climber, who may have been the first of her kind, though we
doubt it. She is interested sentimentally in the son of this house.
Her father, learning of her infatuation for the young man without
learning also that it is imaginary on the young girl’s part, starts
out to discover his intentions. He is a poor inventor. The
mother of the youth, ambitious chiefly for her children, shudders
at the thought of marriage for her son with a sewing-girl.
But the Prince contrives to put the slipper on the right foot, and
the end is happiness. The play is quaint and agreeable and the
three acts are rich in the charm of love and youth. (Royalty,
twenty-five dollars.)</p>

2¼ hours.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>In “The Lottery Man” Rida Johnson Young has seized upon
a custom of some newspapers to increase their circulation by
clever schemes. Mrs. Young has made the central figure in her
famous comedy a newspaper reporter, Jack Wright. Wright owes
his employer money, and he agrees to turn in one of the most
sensational scoops the paper has ever known. His idea is to
conduct a lottery, with <em>himself</em> as the prize. The lottery is announced.
Thousands of old maids buy coupons. Meantime Wright
falls in love with a charming girl. Naturally he fears that he
may be won by someone else and starts to get as many tickets
as his limited means will permit. Finally the last day is announced.
The winning number is 1323, and is held by Lizzie,
an old maid, in the household of the newspaper owner. Lizzie
refuses to give up. It is discovered, however, that she has stolen
the ticket. With this clue, the reporter threatens her with arrest.
Of course the coupon is surrendered and Wright gets the girl of
his choice. Produced at the Bijou Theater, New York, with
great success. (Royalty, twenty-five dollars.)</p>

girls of to-day should be CHARM. The situations that arise are
teeming with humor&mdash;clean, wholesome humor. In the end the
young man gives up the school, and promises to wait until the
most precocious of his pupils reaches a marriageable age. The
play has the freshness of youth, the inspiration of an extravagant
but novel idea, the charm of originality, and the promise of wholesome,
sanely amusing, pleasant entertainment. We strongly recommend
it for high school production. It was first produced at
the Bijou Theatre, New York, then toured the country. Two
companies are now playing it in England. (Royalty, twenty-five
dollars.)</p>

<p class="p2 center fs175">KICK IN</p>

<p>Play in 4 acts.   By Willard Mack.   7 males, 5 females.
2 interiors. Modern costumes. Plays 2½ hours.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Kick In” is the latest of the very few available mystery
plays. Like “Within the Law,” “Seven Keys to Baldpate,”
“The Thirteenth Chair,” and “In the Next Room,” it is one
of those thrillers which are accurately described as “not having
a dull moment in it from beginning to end.” It is a play with
all the ingredients of popularity, not at all difficult to set or to
act; the plot carries it along, and the situations are built with
that skill and knowledge of the theatre for which Willard Mack
is known. An ideal mystery melodrama, for high schools and
colleges.   (Royalty, twenty-five dollars.)</p>

<p class="p2 center fs175">TILLY OF BLOOMSBURY</p>

<p>(“Happy-Go-Lucky.”) A comedy in 3 acts. By Ian
Hay. 9 males, 7 females. 2 interior scenes. Modern
dress. Plays a full evening.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>Into an aristocratic family comes Tilly, lovable and youthful,
with ideas and manners which greatly upset the circle. Tilly
is so frankly honest that she makes no secret of her tremendous
affection for the young son of the family; this brings her
into many difficulties. But her troubles have a joyous end in
charmingly blended scenes of sentiment and humor. This comedy
presents an opportunity for fine acting, handsome stage settings,
and beautiful costuming. (Royalty, twenty-five dollars.)</p>

<p class="rt">Price, 75 cents.</p>
</div>


<p class="p2 center fs175">BILLY</p>

<p>Farce-comedy in 3 acts. By George Cameron. 10 males,
5 females. (A few minor male parts can be doubled, making
the cast 7 males, 5 females.) 1 exterior. Costumes,
modern. Plays 2¼ hours.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>The action of the play takes place on the S. S. “Florida,”
bound for Havana. The story has to do with the disappearance of
a set of false teeth, which creates endless complications among
passengers and crew, and furnishes two and a quarter hours of
the heartiest laughter. One of the funniest comedies produced in
the last dozen years on the American stage is “Billy” (sometimes
called “Billy’s Tombstones”), in which the late Sidney
Drew achieved a hit in New York and later toured the country
several times. (Royalty, twenty-five dollars.)</p>

<p class="p2 center fs175">TWEEDLES</p>

<p>Comedy in 3 acts, by Booth Tarkington and Harry Leon
Wilson. 5 males, 4 females. 1 interior. Costumes, modern.
Plays 2½ hours.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>Julian, scion of the blue-blooded Castleburys, falls in love with
Winsora Tweedle, daughter of the oldest family in a Maine village.
The Tweedles esteem the name because it has been rooted in
the community for 200 years, and they look down on “summer
people” with the vigor that only “summer boarder” communities
know.</p>

<p>The Castleburys are aghast at the possibility of a match, and
call on the Tweedles to urge how impossible such an alliance would
be. Mr. Castlebury laboriously explains the barrier of social
caste, and the elder Tweedle takes it that these unimportant
summer folk are terrified at the social eminence of the Tweedles.</p>

<p>Tweedle generously agrees to co-operate with the Castleburys
to prevent the match. But Winsora brings her father to realize
that in reality the Castleburys look upon them as inferiors. The
old man is infuriated, and threatens vengeance, but is checkmated
when Julian unearths a number of family skeletons and argues
that father isn’t a Tweedle, since the blood has been so diluted
that little remains. Also, Winsora takes the matter into her own
hands and outfaces the old man. So the youngsters go forth
triumphant. “Tweedles” is Booth Tarkington at his best.

<p class="p2 center fs175">JUST SUPPOSE</p>

<p>A whimsical comedy in 3 acts, by A. E. Thomas, author
of “Her Husband’s Wife,” “Come Out of the Kitchen,”
etc. 6 males, 2 females. 1 interior, 1 exterior. Costumes,
modern. Plays 2¼ hours.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>It was rumored that during his last visit the Prince of Wales
appeared for a brief spell under an assumed name somewhere in
Virginia. It is on this story that A. E. Thomas based “Just
Suppose.” The theme is handled in an original manner. Linda
Lee Stafford meets one George Shipley (in reality is the Prince
of Wales). It is a case of love at first sight, but, alas, princes
cannot select their mates and thereby hangs a tale which Mr.
Thomas has woven with infinite charm. The atmosphere of the
South with its chivalry dominates the story, touching in its
sentiment and lightened here and there with delightful comedy.
“Just Suppose” scored a big hit at the Henry Miller Theatre,
New York, with Patricia Collinge. (Royalty, twenty-five dollars.)</p>

<p class="p2 center fs175">ARE YOU A MASON?</p>

<p>Farce in 3 acts. By Leo Ditrichstein. 7 males, 7 females.
Modern costumes. Plays 2¼ hours. 1 interior.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Are You a Mason?” is one of those delightful farces like
“Charley’s Aunt” that are always fresh. “A mother and a
daughter,” says the critic of the New York <em>Herald</em>, “had husbands
who account for absences from the joint household on
frequent evenings, falsely pretending to be Masons. The men
do not know each other’s duplicity, and each tells his wife of
having advanced to leadership in his lodge. The older woman
was so well pleased with her husband’s supposed distinction in
the order that she made him promise to put up the name of a
visiting friend for membership. Further perplexity over the
principal liar arose when a suitor for his second daughter’s hand
proved to be a real Mason.... To tell the story of the play
would require volumes, its complications are so numerous. It is
a house of cards. One card wrongly placed and the whole thing
would collapse. But it stands, an example of remarkable ingenuity.
You wonder at the end of the first act how the fun
can be kept up on such a slender foundation. But it continues
and grows to the last curtain.” One of the most hilariously
amusing farces ever written, especially suited to schools and
Masonic Lodges. (Royalty, twenty-five dollars.)</p>

<p class="rt">Price, 75 Cents.</p>
</div>


<p class="p2 center fs175">KEMPY</p>

<p>A delightful comedy in 3 acts. By J. C. Nugent and
Elliott Nugent. 4 males, 4 females. 1 interior throughout.
Costumes, modern. Plays 2½ hours.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>No wonder “Kempy” has been such a tremendous hit in New
York, Chicago&mdash;wherever it has played. It snaps with wit and
humor of the most delightful kind. It’s electric. It’s small-town
folk perfectly pictured. Full of types of varied sorts, each
one done to a turn and served with zestful sauce. An ideal
entertainment for amusement purposes. The story is about a high-falutin’
daughter who in a fit of pique marries the young plumber-architect,
who comes to fix the water pipes, just because he
“understands” her, having read her book and having sworn to
marry the authoress. But in that story lies all the humor that
kept the audience laughing every second of every act. Of course
there are lots of ramifications, each of which bears its own brand
of laughter-making potentials. But the plot and the story are
not the main things. There is, for instance, the work of the
company. The fun growing out of this family mixup is lively and
clean. (Royalty, twenty-five dollars.)</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
